# Common Passwords Analysis Project
## Project Overview

This project involves the use of Jupyter Notebooks to scrape and analyze a dataset of the 10,000 most common passwords. Utilizing Python's BeautifulSoup library, we efficiently extracted this significant dataset from publicly available sources on the internet. Post-scraping, the data was cleaned, organized, and analyzed using the Pandas library, offering insights into password trends, security vulnerabilities, and commonalities among frequently used passwords.

The end goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive analysis of common password patterns to understand better the security risks associated with predictable passwords and to encourage the development of more secure authentication methods.

## Key Features
- **Data Extraction**: Leveraged BeautifulSoup to navigate and parse HTML from targeted webpages, successfully scraping a dataset of the 10,000 most common passwords.
- **Data Processing & Analysis**: Utilized Pandas for data cleaning and analysis, transforming the raw data into a structured format suitable for in-depth analysis.
- **Insightful Observations**: Conducted preliminary analysis to identify trends, such as the most common characters, length of passwords, and patterns that emerge from the dataset.
- **Accessibility**: Included the final dataset as an .xlsx file within the GitHub repository, allowing for easy access and further analysis by others.

**Getting Started**
To dive into this project, you'll need to have Python installed along with Jupyter Notebooks. The primary libraries used are BeautifulSoup and Pandas, so ensure these are installed in your Python environment:

```
pip install beautifulsoup4 pandas jupyter
```
Once installed, you can clone the repository and launch Jupyter Notebooks to open the project file:

```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd [project-directory]
jupyter notebook
```
## Future Project Ideas and Insights
With this dataset of common passwords, there are numerous avenues for further exploration and application. Here are a few ideas:
- Security Analysis: Utilize this dataset to evaluate the security strength of password policies for various online platforms, helping to strengthen authentication processes.
- Predictive Modeling: Develop machine learning models to predict password strength or to generate secure password recommendations based on common vulnerabilities found in the dataset.
- Educational Tools: Create interactive web applications or tools that educate users about password security, using real data to highlight the risks of using common passwords.
- Pattern Recognition: Conduct a deeper analysis to identify unique patterns or sequences commonly used in passwords, which could inform more robust password generation algorithms.
